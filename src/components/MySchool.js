        I attended Musaeus College, a place that has greatly contributed to my
        personal and academic growth. It is located in Kurunduwatte Colombo 07. 
        Musaeus College is a Buddhist private girls' school in Colombo, Sri Lanka.
        Our Principal is Mrs.Sajeewani Bandara. There are about 350-400 teachers 
        in our school and there about 6500-7000 students in Musaues College. The 
        school is named after its founding principal, Marie Musaeus Higgins from 
        Wismar, Germany, who served as the school's principal from 1891 to 1926.
        Musaeus College was founded in 1891 by four founders who are Marie Musaeus 
        Hinggins, Peter De Abrew, Henry Steel Olcott and Annie Besant.
