# üåü About Myself

Hello! My name is Sanuli Cooray.
I am 14 years old and from Wijerama.

I've been passionate about web development for almost two years, starting in 2023.
Currently, I study at Musaeus College Colombo 07.

I love playing badminton and enjoy swimming. Unlike many other girls, I absolutely love rugby, and my favorite team is the All Blacks (New Zealand).

I don‚Äôt really like most flowers, but there are two I truly love: Cherry Blossoms (Sakura) and Red Roses.

I‚Äôm a huge animal lover and have a dog and three cats.

Some people think I look cold and distant, but those who truly know me understand that I am supportive, kind, and warm-hearted.

üí° Special Thanks
The one who helped me the most in this journey is Mr. Nipuna Ranbukkange.
He has been an amazing teacher, guiding my classmates and me through every step and supporting us when we faced challenges. His dedication and encouragement mean a lot!

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
